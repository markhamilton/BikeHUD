This is a PyQt project designed to display vital information on a heads-up display for a bike, as well as provide PWM output for a high-voltage motor.

Currently this project is in development and cannot be used.

This was meant to run on a Beaglebone using a touch-screen shield, and a high-amp motor controller to run the bike wheel coils. With some modification this should be able to run similarly on an arduino as well.

More information is coming soon, including snapshots, the hardware used and how to make modifications to fit your needs.
